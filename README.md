# Vehicle Tracker: An open-source multi-model framework for public transport arrival prediction

This repository contain a novel framework for *multi-model* arrival prediction in public transport systems. With *multi-model*, we emphasize the ability for the framework to simultaneously maintain and supply predictions for the arrival of public transport services using multiple, and possibly overlapping, machine learning models. This ability allows the framework to act as an ensemble of the base models and provides both robustness, flexibility, and enhanced prediction accuracy. The framework automatically collect and monitor base model performance in order to weigh between each of the base models applicable for a given *spatial* and *temporal* reference context. We present a framework architecture building on proven methods for achieving a scalable and sustainable system, that can be configured to consume computational power only when needed, minimizing operational cost and climate footprint for public transport authorities using the system. Finally, we present and discuss findings during experimental deployments of the framework for a regional public transport authority in Denmark.
